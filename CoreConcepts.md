## 🦠 Malware Analysis : (Examining)

- Malware : Software specifically designed to disrupt, damage, or gain unauthorized access to computers, networks, or data. example : spyware, ransomware, trojan etc. 
- The process of examining malicious software to understand it's behaviour and impact on the system. Example : Static & Dynamic Analysis. 

## 🔍 Reverse Engineering : 

- The process of disassembling and decompiling software to understand how it works. 
- It is used to analyse program logic, discover vulnerabilities or study malware behaviour. Reverse Engineering is not limited to malware alone It’s a general skill used to understand how any software, system, or hardware works.

##  📱 Mobile Security : 

- The process of protecting smartphones, tablets and thier apps from the threats. It's a defence mechanism.
- Focuses on secure storage, rooting detection.

## 🌐 Web & API Security : 

- It's a set of practices and technologies used to protect websites, web applications, and APIs from attacks.
- Focuses on proctecting data, preventing unauthorised access, blocking common attacks, protecting communication between services.

## 🔐 Encryption : 

- Encryption is the process of converting information into a coded form so only authorised person can read it.
- Symmetric Encryption uses one key for both. example : AES
- Asymmetric Encryption uses  two different keys example : RSA, ECC.

## 🧩 Hooking :

- Hooking is a technique used to intercept, monitor and modify the function calls, messages or events in a program.
- Legitimate purposes: Debugging, Monitoring, adding features. Malicious purposes : Keyloggers, API hooking to steal credentials
